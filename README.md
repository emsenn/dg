# emsenn's digital garden
*in midst of a million nightmares, a hold on one dream*

My digital garden is a collection of digital resources I've cultivated through a medley of different methods.

There exists in the garden an `engine` (written in Fennel), that provides an interface for entering and manipulating the garden.

The rest is too new to really document.


## How to...

### ...run the engine
`fennel engine.fnl`

### ...connect to the engine
`telnet localhost 4242`

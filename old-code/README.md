# emsenn's digital garden
*in midst of a million nightmares, a hold on one dream*

***emsenn's digital garden*** is a collection of digital resources I've cultivated through a medley of different methods.

There exists in the garden an `engine` (written in Fennel), that provides an interface for entering and manipulating the garden.

The rest is too new to really document.

## Usage
`fennel RUN.fnl`

then `telnet localhost 4242` to log in.

Otherwise, use the REPL to poke around!

## Plans
### Soon
- [ ] Add a talker (chat channels)
- [ ] Add a reference library
- [ ] Add user profiles
  - [ ] Add `finger` command (lol, but its tradish)
### Later
- [ ] Add colours to the MUD-server output
### Someday
- Add MXP, MSSP, etc., support.
